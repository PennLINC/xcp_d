## 0.10.0

This backwards-incompatible release brings XCP-D further in line with the fMRIPost workflows in the NiPreps ecosystem.
We have added the ability to provide custom confound sets defined as YAML config files,
ingress derivatives from fMRIPost BIDS Apps (for example, fMRIPost-AROMA),
and provide external atlases organized as BIDS-Atlas datasets.

Please note that the BIDS-Atlas extension proposal has not been merged into BIDS yet,
so the expected organization of these external atlas datasets may change over time.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/PennLINC/xcp_d/compare/0.9.0...0.9.1


## 0.9.0

This backwards-incompatible release makes two important breaking changes.
First, we changed the default file format for 'linc' mode from NIfTI to CIFTI.
Second, XCP-D no longer ingresses and warps the anatomical tissue segmentation file (`*_dseg.nii.gz`),
since no one was using it and it's easy enough to collect separately.

Additionally, this release fixes a bug with the collection of sphere files needed to warp fsnative surfaces to fsLR space,
which should only affect derivatives from fMRIPrep and Nibabies versions >= 24.0.0
(i.e., versions that include `space-fsnative` in the spheres' filenames).

### üõ† Breaking Changes

* Change linc mode default file format to CIFTI by @tsalo in https://github.com/PennLINC/xcp_d/pull/1248

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/PennLINC/xcp_d/compare/0.8.0...0.8.1


## 0.8.0

This is a backwards-incompatible release that will be used to postprocess the beta version of the first release of the HBCD dataset.
There are two major breaking changes.
First, there is a new required `--mode` parameter that automatically defines sets of parameters to match recommendations from different studies/labs.
Each parameter that the `--mode` parameter controls can be overridden, so users should be able to reproduce their original settings from previous versions of XCP-D.
Second, XCP-D now loads certain sphere files from the BIDS derivatives, rather than non-BIDS Freesurfer or MCRIBS folders.
This means that the anatomical workflow (`--warp-surfaces-native2std`) will only work for fMRIPrep versions >= 23.1.0 and Nibabies versions >= 23.1.0.
The rest of XCP-D should still work for versions of fMRIPrep and Nibabies that were supported previously, but we cannot guarantee this.

### üõ† Breaking Changes

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/PennLINC/xcp_d/compare/0.7.4...0.7.5


## 0.7.4

This is a patch release that fixes two important bugs.
The two bugs are:
(1) band-pass filter values were not respected in versions 0.7.1 - 0.7.3 (they were hardcoded to 0.01 - 0.1) and
(2) when processing CIFTI files, parcellated ReHo values in TSVs were not correct, due to a problem with how we were reconstructing CIFTI ReHo files.
The dense CIFTI files should still be usable though.

## 0.3.0

We are happy to announce a new minor release, with several backwards-incompatible changes.

Two big breaking changes are (1) there is a new `--dcan-qc` flag that determines if the executive summary and DCAN-format QC files will be generated, and (2) custom confounds should now have headers, should be tab-delimited, and should have the same names as the fMRIPrep confounds, for easier indexing.

## 0.2.0

This is a big release. There are a lot of backwards-incompatible changes, as well as a number of bug-fixes and enhancements.

There is a full list of the changes made between 0.1.3 and 0.2.0 below. However, here are some highlights:

1. We have renamed and reorganized a number of the outputs created by `xcp_d` to better follow BIDS convention. There is a lot in `xcp_d` that falls outside the current BIDS specification, so we took inspiration from a number of BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs) that folks have written over the years.
2. There is a new `--warp-surfaces-native2std` flag, which produces a number of subject-specific surfaces in fsLR space. This was previously run by default in version 0.1.3. The workflow that this flag triggers is also much improved, thanks to @madisoth.
3. We have fixed a major bug, in which the parameter set users selected was ignored, and "36P" was used no matter what.
4. The HTML reports have been improved. The interactive segmentation image from the executive summary has been added to the main report, along with the BOLD-T1w coregistration figure. We have also added a new plot to show the impact of filtering motion parameters on censoring.

* Ensure TSV files are tab-delimited by @tsalo in https://github.com/PennLINC/xcp_d/pull/541

    Nuisance regressors were selected according to the 'acompcor_gsr' strategy.
    The top 5 aCompCor principal components from the white matter and
    cerebrospinal fluid compartments were selected as nuisance regressors
    [@behzadi2007component],
    along with the six motion parameters and their temporal derivatives,
    mean white matter signal, mean cerebrospinal fluid signal, and mean global signal
    [@benchmarkp;@satterthwaite_2013].
    As the aCompCor regressors were generated on high-pass filtered data,
    the associated cosine basis regressors were included.
    This has the effect of high-pass filtering the data as well.
